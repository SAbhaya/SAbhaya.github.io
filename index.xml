      <description>Past few days I was busy with DataCamp lessons and not much time for write something new. I have transfred by previous blog entries(SnD Creations) to new repository and used blogdown with beautifulhugo theme.
Several Hugo themes have been used beofre selecting beautifulhugo theme. I want somehting similar to bootstrap with fixed navigation bar, plus support for Math.
Thanks to blogdown book from Yihui Xie, finally I have re-launched the site using blogdown &amp;amp; Hugo.</description>

      <title>Keyboard Backlight - Dell - Ubuntu</title>

      <description>I have realised my Dell laptop keyborad backlight doesn&amp;rsquo;t light up in Ubuntu. So did some browsing and changed the config file.
 Set the brightness level to &amp;gt; 0 using below, you need to change the value using super user (or root). Open the config using nano editor.  sudo nano /sys/devices/platform/dell-laptop/leds/dell\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness change the value 0, I have changed it to 2, then save the config.
 Also if required we can set the timeout of the keyboard backlight.</description>
