      <description>Past few days I was busy with DataCamp lessons and not much time for write something new. I have transfred by previous blog entries(SnD Creations) to new repository and used blogdown with beautifulhugo theme.
Several Hugo themes have been used beofre selecting beautifulhugo theme. I want somehting similar to bootstrap with fixed navigation bar, plus support for Math.
Thanks to blogdown book from Yihui Xie, finally I have re-launched the site using blogdown &amp;amp; Hugo.</description>
